# Module 01: Cybersecurity AI Landscape

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the evolution of cybersecurity technologies and methodologies.
- Examine the shift from traditional signature-based detection to AI-driven threat hunting.
- Identify major AI applications utilized in cybersecurity and their functions.

## Evolution of Cybersecurity
The cybersecurity field has evolved significantly over the years:
1. **Signature-Based Detection**: Initial cybersecurity frameworks relied heavily on known signatures to detect threats. This method often lagged behind emerging malware variants and sophisticated attack methods.

2. **AI-Powered Threat Hunting**: Transitioning into AI, organizations now leverage machine learning algorithms to proactively hunt for advanced persistent threats (APTs) and unknown malware. This shift enhances detection capabilities and reduces response times.

## Major AI Applications in Cybersecurity
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Tools like **Darktrace** and **Vectra AI** utilize behavioral analytics to identify anomalous behavior that could indicate a potential threat.
- **Malware Analysis and Classification**: AI enables rapid classification and analysis of malware, improving forensic capabilities and response strategies.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Platforms like **Splunk** and **Elastic Security** harness AI for real-time analysis of security alerts and incident responses.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Solutions like **CrowdStrike Falcon** and **SentinelOne** prevent threats at endpoint levels using advanced AI techniques.
- **Vulnerability Assessment Automation**: AI enhances the identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities, allowing organizations to mitigate risks more effectively.
- **Phishing Detection**: AI-driven systems automate the detection of phishing attempts by analyzing patterns and indicators of malicious intent.
- **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**: AI analyzes the behaviors of users and entities to detect irregularities potentially indicative of insider threats.
- **Deception Technology**: Deception frameworks use AI to create traps or deceptive environments to lure attackers and gather intelligence.
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms**: These platforms utilize AI to aggregate, analyze, and disseminate threat data to enhance situational awareness.
- **Cybersecurity AI Tech Stack**: Integrating various components including SIEM, EDR, SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) platforms to create a comprehensive defense mechanism.
- **Security Operations Center (SOC) Automation**: AI triages alerts and streamlines response strategies within SOC environments, optimizing resource allocation.

## Adversarial AI Concerns
- **Evasion Attacks**: Techniques used by attackers to evade detection mechanisms, undermining the effectiveness of AI systems.
- **Poisoning Attacks**: Malicious modifications made to training data can skew AI decision-making processes.
- **Model Stealing**: Attackers seek to replicate AI models to either exploit or circumvent protective measures.

## Major Vendors in the Field
- **Darktrace**: Known for its autonomous response capabilities, Darktrace detected WannaCry ransomware outbreaks before signature updates were instituted.
- **CrowdStrike**: Prevents approximately 2 trillion attacks annually by employing a proactive approach to threat detection and endpoint security.
- **Palo Alto Networks Cortex**: Integrates AI across security workflows to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of threat detection.

## Compliance Frameworks
- **NIST CSF**: Guidelines to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk.
- **SOC 2**: Framework that focuses on data security and privacy.
- **ISO 27001**: Standard for information security management systems (ISMS).
- **GDPR Security Requirements**: Ensures data protection and privacy for individuals in the European Union.

## Unique Challenges in Cybersecurity AI
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Building AI systems resilient to manipulations intended to disrupt detection capabilities.
- **Explainability for Security Analysts**: Ensuring that AI-driven decisions can be interpreted and understood by human analysts.
- **False Positive/Negative Tradeoffs**: Managing the balance between detecting true threats while minimizing false alerts that can desensitize security teams.
- **Insider Threat Detection Ethics**: Navigating the complexities of monitoring employee activities without infringing on privacy rights.
- **Automated Response Authorization**: Developing policies and technologies that enable automated actions in response to detected threats while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
